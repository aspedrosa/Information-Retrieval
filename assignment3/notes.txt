Modelling changes to support fields on indexing

- DocumentParser classes should receive an implementation on their contructor
that decides what type of Document to create

- Create Child classes of the class Document. One that holds fields and another
just simple terms

- The Pipeline class will follow the same approach of the DocumentParser Clas. This
allows to use SPIMI, and then choose if we use fields on the indexing process or not
without having to create another Pipeline class
